# TechShopWithStripe

### An E-shopping app with Stripe Integration

Created by: Julia Mattson, Mohsin Rahman and Amir Shishehgari

To build and start this project the first thing you have to do is make sure that Node and Express is installed on the project. To install express to the project you simply write "npm install express" in the terminal. 
Also, since this project is using Stripe as payment method you need to install stripe and also Dotenv which you will use to define your secret key from your Stripe account.
We also installed Nodemon but that's not neccessary but it can ease the developing process. 
To install these dependencies just install them through the terminal the same way as you did with Express.
After that you just write "nodemon server.js" to run the application.
